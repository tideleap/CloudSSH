## Highlights

### Ultimate Serverless

- **Zero Server Cost**: Pure frontend deployment + Cloudflare Workers, no need to build your own backend servers.
- **Edge Acceleration**: Benefit from Cloudflare's global edge network, enjoying low-latency SSH connections from anywhere.

### Out of the Box

- **One-Click Deployment**: Build and deploy the project with a single command using the Wrangler CLI.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS, paired with xterm.js to provide a silky smooth terminal experience.

### Secure and Reliable

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Complete implementation of the SSH-2.0 protocol, including ECDH key exchange, Ed25519 signature authentication, and AES-256-GCM data encryption.
- **Security Hardening**: Built-in SSRF protection against IPv6 and reserved IPs, API rate limiting (anti-brute force), and local AES-GCM encryption for your stored server credentials.
- **Human Verification**: Supports Cloudflare Turnstile verification to prevent malicious bot abuse.
- **Isolated Session State**: Leveraging Cloudflare Durable Objects and the Hibernation API, every terminal session runs securely and persistently within its sandbox.

<a id="features"></a>
## Features

- **Full SSH Handshake**: Native TypeScript implementation of the SSH transport layer and user authentication protocols.
- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual Stack**: Full support for both IPv4 and IPv6 address connections, including automatic handling of IPv6 bracket notation.
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: Supports standard SSH password authentication as well as Ed25519 plaintext private key authentication.
- **MitM Protection (TOFU)**: Automatically extracts and prints the server's Host Key (SHA-256 fingerprint) on the first connection, preventing eavesdropping by malicious nodes.
- **Geek Terminal Experience**: Powered by `@xterm/xterm` and the `@xterm/addon-webgl` hardware acceleration rendering engine, ensuring silky smooth scrolling even with massive log outputs.
- **Customizable UI**: Switch seamlessly between classic terminal themes like Cyberpunk, Glacier, and Gruvbox, fully optimized for mobile devices.
- **Native File Transfer**: Integrated with [trzsz.js](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz.js), supporting `trz` (upload) / `tsz` (download) commands for file transfer, fully compatible with tmux sessions. Also supports drag-and-drop file upload to the terminal, directory transfer, and resumable transfers. (Requires [trzsz](https://trzsz.github.io/) installed on the remote server)

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Browser["Browser Client<br/>(TypeScript + xterm.js)"]
    CF["Cloudflare Edge Network"]
    DO["Durable Object<br/>(SSH Session Management)"]
    Server["Target SSH Server<br/>(e.g., Linux VPS)"]

    Browser <-->|"WebSocket<br/>(Frontend UI Input & Terminal Output)"| CF
    CF <-->|"WebSocket"<br/>Routing & Long-lived Connection| DO
    DO <-->|"TCP Socket<br/>@cloudflare/sockets"| Server
```

1. The user enters the host IP, username, and password on the frontend.
2. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend Durable Object.
3. The DO receives the credentials and establishes a TCP connection with the target SSH server using `@cloudflare/sockets`.
4. The DO handles the entire SSH protocol negotiation (key exchange, password auth, etc.) in pure code and forwards the encrypted terminal data to the frontend via WebSocket.

## Quick Deployment

### Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account.
- Node.js environment (v18+).
- Cloudflare Workers Free Plan enabled (required for TCP Sockets and Durable Objects features).

### Steps

#### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Configure Domain**: Before deploying, you must modify the custom domain in `wrangler.toml` to your own domain (Note: The domain must be registered or active in Cloudflare beforehand).
3. **Setup Deployment**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Workers & Pages to connect your GitHub account, and select the forked repository.
4. **Build Command**: During the deployment configuration, make sure to enter `npm install && npm run build:frontend` as the Build command, then deploy with one click (the build output directory can be left blank).

#### Method 2: Local CLI Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newbietan/CloudSSH.git
   cd CloudSSH
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Login to Cloudflare**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

4. **One-Click Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

Once deployed, Wrangler will output your Worker URL. Open that URL in your browser to start using your Web SSH terminal.

#### Optional: Configure Turnstile Human Verification

To prevent malicious bot abuse, it is recommended to enable Cloudflare Turnstile verification:

1. **Create Turnstile Widget**: Log in to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to the Turnstile page and create a new Widget.
2. **Get Keys**: After creation, you will receive a **Site Key** (public) and a **Secret Key** (private).
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - **Method 1 (GitHub)**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, add the following environment variables:
     - `TURNSTILE_SECRET` = your Secret Key
     - `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` = your Site Key
   - **Method 2 (CLI)**: Uncomment `TURNSTILE_SECRET` and `TURNSTILE_SITEKEY` in `wrangler.toml` and enter your keys.
4. **Redeploy**: Run the deployment command to apply the configuration.

> **Note**: Turnstile verification is session-level. After verification, all features are available for the current session. Closing the browser will require re-verification.

#### Optional: Configure GitHub OAuth Login & Server Management

With GitHub OAuth enabled, users can log in with their GitHub account and save/manage their frequently used SSH servers in a personal dashboard for one-click connections. When not configured, this feature is automatically hidden and does not affect the anonymous SSH connection functionality.

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth App**:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → [New OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
   - **Application name**: `CloudSSH` (customizable)
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback`
   - After creation, note the **Client ID**, then click **Generate a new client secret** to get the **Client Secret** (shown only once, save it immediately)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - **Method 1 (GitHub)**: In the Cloudflare Dashboard Workers settings, add:
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` = your Client ID
     - `BASE_URL` = `https://your-domain.com` (your deployed domain)
   - **Method 2 (CLI)**: Uncomment `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `BASE_URL` in `wrangler.toml` and enter your values.

3. **Set Secrets (Sensitive Information)**:
   - After deploying the project, go to Cloudflare Dashboard → your Worker project (`cloudssh`) → **Settings** → **Variables and Secrets**.
   - Click **Add** under Environment Variables:
     - **Type**: Select **Secret** (Important: Do not select Text)
     - **Variable name**: `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
     - **Value**: Paste your Client Secret
   - Click **Save and deploy**.

4. **Redeploy**: If you just added the variables and are enabling the feature for the first time, you must delete the old deployment and redeploy to initialize the database.

> **Note**: Server credentials (passwords/private keys) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage. The local encryption key is automatically generated and safely stored in the database (you can also manually override it by setting `SESSION_SECRET` in environment variables). During connection, credentials never pass through the frontend — they are securely transmitted via a one-time-token mechanism.

> **Important**: Enabling this feature for the first time requires a clean deployment (delete the old Worker first, then redeploy) to initialize the new Durable Object. Use `npx wrangler delete cloudssh` to remove the old Worker, then run `npm run deploy` to redeploy.

## Development

This project consists of two parts:
1. **Frontend**: Located in the `frontend/` directory, built with Vite.
2. **Worker**: Located in the `src/` directory, containing the Cloudflare Worker entry point and the core SSH protocol implementation.

For local development, you can run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command starts Wrangler's local development environment server.
